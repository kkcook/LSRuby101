# We want to double the numbers by mutating the original array
# Input array, output array
# Edge cases are 0, input is assumed to be an integer
# Data structure is array
# Iterate through array with loop
# Going to set each element of the input array to current number variable
# Going to set array element to equal 2 * current number
# Perform task until count == array.size
